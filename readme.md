# Overview
This mod adds colorful glowing trails to trains as they drive around

----------
# Features
- Color and Glow can be independently enabled or disabled
- Size and Length of the trail can be changed in mod settings
- Trail color can either sync to the train or use one of over 70 animated color themes
- Fully compatible with multiplayer, modded trains, and the space age expansion
- Passenger mode toggle: only draws trails for trains with players in them
- Includes main menu background simulation integration that reflects the current active mod settings
- Four performance modes to balance visual quality and game performance: beautiful, pretty, balanced, and efficient
- Optimized for minimal UPS impact. The mod should have little to no noticeable impact on game performance; trails are only rendered for active trains on visible surfaces, and rendering is tightly controlled to minimize draw calls and reduce render preparation time and overall GPU load.
